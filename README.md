Deep Learning Image Classification for Eclipsing Binary Light Curves

We present an image classification algorithm using deep learning convolutional neural network architecture, which classifies the morphologies of eclipsing binary systems based on their light curves. The algorithm trains the machine with light curve images of eclipsing binary stars in three morphological types, contact, detached and semi-detached, whose light curves are provided by three catalogs: Kepler, ASAS and CALEB. The details of the architecture, which is selected among 132, are discussed. Our results show that the algorithm estimates the morphological classes of an independent dataset with an accuracy of 91\%.
